# java-password-generator

I decided to make a simple password generator using Java to further develop my Java skill. 
The password generator uses Java Swing Framework to display Graphical User Interface. 

User is able to generate password with different length and combinations of characters. 
After generating the password, the password quality and entropy are shown.

Password entropy is calculated by taking multiplying the Length of the password (L) by the log base 2 of the total 
combinations of the available characters.
